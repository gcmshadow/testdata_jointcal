# NOTE: in order to use the data in this package, you need to setup one or more
# of the following obs packages:

# setupRequired(obs_cfht)
# setupRequired(obs_decam)
# setupRequired(obs_subaru)

# These packages are no longer specified as dependencies of testdata_jointcal
# to prevent this package from being installed any time lower parts of the
# DM Science Pipelines are changed.
# If you use testdata_jointcal for your own package's tests, you will have to
# have to add the appropriate setup requirement to that package's eups table
# file and add a SkipTest check like the following to your test's `setUpClass`:
#
# try:
#     cls.data_dir = lsst.utils.getPackageDir('testdata_jointcal')
# except LookupError:
#     raise unittest.SkipTest("testdata_jointcal not setup")
# try:
#     lsst.utils.getPackageDir('obs_subaru')
# except LookupError:
#     raise unittest.SkipTest("obs_subaru not setup")
